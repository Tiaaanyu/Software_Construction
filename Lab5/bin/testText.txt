A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles
that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. 
Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and 
potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon 
the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress.

Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. 
Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person’s lack of theology and geometry; 
it could even cast doubts upon one’s soul.

Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don’t know. I had a telegram from the home: ‘Mother passed away. 
Funeral tomorrow. Yours sincerely.’ That doesn’t mean anything. It may have been yesterday.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago — never mind how long precisely — having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. 
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,
 and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, 
that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off — then,
 I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. 
With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. 
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
